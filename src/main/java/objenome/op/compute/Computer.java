/**
 * Computers provide a mechanism for executing program source code that is
 * being evolved by a grammar based representation or otherwise. There are two
 * approaches to execute program strings provided depending upon the nature of
 * the evolved code.
 *
 * <h4>Expression evaluation</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>eval</code> methods are for use on program strings that represent
 * an individual expression, that will have an individual return value. A simple
 * example of this is a nested lisp expression. The result of evaluating the
 * expression will be returned from the method call.
 *
 * <h4>Statement execution</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>exec</code> methods are for executing program strings that
 * represent one or more full program statements. No value will be returned by
 * these methods so the programs are expected to have other side effects.
