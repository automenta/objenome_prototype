/**
 * A fitness function for that calculates and assigns adjusted fitness scores.
 * The fitness scores are calculated by passing evaluation to a delegate fitness
 * function, which must return an instance of
 * <code>DoubleFitness.Minimise</code>. This value is then converted to
 * standardised fitness by removing any offset of the values (so the minimum
 * possible score is 0.0) and then converted to adjusted fitness using the
 * following formula:
 *
 * <code><blockquote>
 * adjusted-fitness = 1 / (1 + standardised-fitness)
 * </blockquote></code>
 *
 * When using this fitness function the {@link #MINIMUM_FITNESS_SCORE} config
 * option can optionally be set, or the same value set using the mutator method
 * provided. If set, the MINIMUM_FITNESS_SCORE is used to convert the delegate's
 * calculated values to standardised fitness. For example, if the minimum
 * fitness score is 10.0, and the delegate assigns a fitness value of 11.0, then
 * the standardised fitness will be 1.0. In the same example, the adjusted
 * fitness would then be calculated as 0.5 using the formula above.
 *
 * If the MINIMUM_FITNESS_SCORE config option is not set, then it is assumed the
 * delegates calculation is already standardised.
