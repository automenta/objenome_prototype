     * <li>Programmatic Configuration</li>
     * <li>Bean Instantiation through constructors</li>
     * <li>Bean Initialization through setters</li>
     * <li>Dependency Injection through constructors</li>
     * <li>Dependency Injection through setters</li>
     * <li>Auto-wiring through constructors and setters (very simple!)</li>
     * <li>Injection through setters so you can populate any external object with
     * objects from the container</li>
     * <li>Instantiation through constructors so you can instantiate any external
     * class with objects from the container</li>
     * <li>Support for SINGLETON and THREAD scopes, plus you can easily get REQUEST
     * and SESSION scopes for web projects</li>
     * <li>Generic Factories so you can easily turn anything into a object
     * factory</li>
     * <li>Interceptors for factories: onCreated, onCleared, useful for object
     * pooling</li>
