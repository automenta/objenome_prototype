Provides classes that are related to the <i>Stat System</i>.

<P>Stats are implemented by subclassing the {@link org.epochx.event.stat.AbstractStat} class.
The {@link org.epochx.event.stat.AbstractStat} class is not only the base class for stats,
but also provides a mechanism to register and retrieve stat objects. Stats classes are not
instantiated directly, instead they are registered in a repository.</P>
