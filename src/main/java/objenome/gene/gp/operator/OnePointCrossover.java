/**
 * A crossover operator for <code>STGPIndividual</code>s that exchanges subtrees
 * in two individuals. Random crossover points are chosen in both program trees
 * from those points which align in the two programs. Alignment is determined by
 * nodes in the same position having the same arity and data-type, or for the
 * strict form of the operator the nodes must be the same. The crossover points
 * are located in the same position in both program trees and the two subtrees
 * at these points are exchanged. It is recommended that a significant mutation
 * rate (Poli & Langdon use 30%) is used in combination with one-point crossover
 * since it encourages rapid convergence.
 * 
 * For more information about the one-point crossover operator see:<br />
 * R.Poli and W.B.Langdon, Genetic Programming with One-Point Crossover<br />
 * Soft Computing in Engineering Design and Manufacturing, pp. 180-189,
 * Springer-Verlag<br />
